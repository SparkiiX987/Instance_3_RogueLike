  text2: 'After the invasion of the United States, it''s Europe''s turn to meet the
    same fate. Several fault lines, smaller than those in California, have just opened
    on the continent, so we can speculate about the potential arrival of the Crawlers
    on the other side of the Atlantic. Let''s hope for their sake that they fare
    better than us. In the meantime, remember the safety rules: -Stay indoors, with
    your doors closed and barricaded. -If a shelter is nearby, try to reach it as
    quickly as possible. -Stay vigilant, and above all, stay alive. '
