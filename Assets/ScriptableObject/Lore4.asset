  text2: 'To those who find this note, this corpse strewn across the ground is mine.
    I am a survivor of the Las Vegas Oasis, which was decimated by the creepers.
    A religious cult opened its doors to them, proclaiming the salvation of humanity
    and that no one should seek the word of the Lord. I headed to New York after
    hearing on the radio that there was an Oasis there, but unfortunately, I would
    never get there before bleeding out. If you find this letter, and New York is
    still standing, learn from our mistakes. The most dangerous thing today is the
    madness of others. '
