  text2: 'Today, we officially announce the 10,000-resident mark in the Oasis. Unfortunately,
    this is no time for celebration. Illegal trade is more prevalent than ever in
    our city, and existing law enforcement agencies are struggling to regulate it.
    It is said that to obtain supplies, residents are illegally venturing outside
    the Oasis to retrieve ancient artifacts, which they then resell for exorbitant
    prices. Remain vigilant, and above all, do not encourage this practice, which
    endangers our entire community. '
