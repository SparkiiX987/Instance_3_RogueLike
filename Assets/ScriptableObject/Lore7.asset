  text2: 'New York is dead. Winter hit us far too hard and brought us a massive famine.
    From what I''ve heard, a third of the population has already died, 3,000 fucking
    deaths. And I think I''ll be next on the list. Hunger is eating away at me, my
    body is weak, and I feel like my head is going to explode. I''m even considering
    taking my own life to stop the suffering. Please, make it better, if only for
    my children. '
