    it that way, then I have good news for you: get to the New York Oasis as soon
    as possible, a secure zone normally impenetrable by the Crawlers. All bridges
    have been deliberately destroyed, except for the George Washington Bridge, longitude
    40.8517\xB0 North, latitude 73.9527\xB0 West. Good luck, survivors.\""
