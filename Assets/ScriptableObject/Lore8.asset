  text2: "At the beginning of June, some bad news was announced by our explorers.
    All oil sources surrounding New York City have been siphoned off, so if no solution
    is found, New York will be plunged into darkness. Fortunately for us, our scientists
    are redoubling their efforts to increase our renewable energy sources. Solar
    panels, wind turbines, water wheels\u2026 All solutions are welcome! By the end
    of the month, more than twenty wind turbines are expected to appear on the roofs
    of some of the city's buildings. "
